# BankNotes
This plugin allows players inside a server to withdraw money and turn it into a banknote! This note can be used later, and/or saved as a specimen!

# Features
- Everything is customisable inside this plugin, so the owner/administrators have full control on how the plugin works. 
- You can customise the `name`, `lore`, `error + success messages` easily inside the `config.yml` file!
- The plugin loads `POSTWORLD`, so there won't be any trouble saving progress!
- Allows players to create more than one banknote at once. For example, running `/banknote 1000 10` would create 10 banknotes worth `$1000` each, for a total sum of `$10000`!

# Requests? Suggestions? Improvements?
- This is the final version for the plugin, and henceforth any future updates won't be made (unless it's an API change) to the plugin. You are free to fork this repository and make edits/changes to the plugin accordingly. Just credit me!
- If you have any questions, please message me on Discord: `gsets#0001` or open a new issue!
